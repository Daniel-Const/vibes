# Vibes

A terminal audio visualizer written in Rust

![alt text](https://github.com/Daniel-Const/vibes/blob/main/public/vibes-demo.gif)

Sound data is retrieved from the device microphone. A wave visualisation is rendered in the terminal responding to the audio data.
Playing music from the same device works too!
